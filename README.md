# Team Profile HTML Generator

## Description

The purpose of this generator is to prompt the developer(s) a series of questions about their team that generates an HTML page. 
The questions asked by the application are the managers name, id, email, and office number. It also prompts the user to select
between an engineer, intern, or finsih the inputs. When a engineer is selected, the command prompt prompts the user the engineers
name, id, email, and github username. When the intern option is selected it prompts the user for the interns name, id, email, and 
school.

Once all the data is inputed and the `Finish building my Team` option was selected, then the program generates an `index.html`
document in the /dist/ folder. There you can find a corresponding `styles.css` file.
